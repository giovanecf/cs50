# FAQ

- Why has exercices made in JS?
  Cause when I started, I thought CS50 has just another programming courses. Much better, cause... Harvard... but just another one. And besides, I already knew how to program. I've been doing it for so long... And has just part of the [OSSU Course](https://github.com/ossu/computer-science) that I'm taking... But turns out, I was wrong.... TOO wrong...
  Then I decide to restart from week-1, as it should be done: with C language.
