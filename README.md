## FAQ

### Why has solutions in JS?

Cause when I started, I thought CS50 has just another programming courses, much better, cause... Harvard... but just another one. And besides, I already knew how to program. I've been doing it for so long... Was just part of the [OSSU Course](https://github.com/ossu/computer-science) that I'm taking...
BUT, turns out, I was wrong.... TOO wrong... Then I decide to restart from week-1, as it should be done: with C language.
